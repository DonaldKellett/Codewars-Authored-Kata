Want to challenge yourself to write an interpreter from scratch?  Then I've definitely got something challenging for you that you will surely enjoy.  Behold ... the Boolfuck Interpreter!  [Boolfuck](http://samuelhughes.com/boof/index.html) is an esoteric programming language derived from the famous [Brainfuck](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) in 2004-2005 which is very similar to Brainfuck itself except that Boolfuck operates on bits instead of bytes which makes it all the harder to both implement an interpreter for and actually program in it.

Have you always been fascinated by the very concept of object-oriented programming (OOP)?  How you can define your own data structures using the `class` keyword, create a whole category of interrelated classes by classical inheritance using `extends`, etc.  If that is the case then this series is for you!  In this Series, we will explore everything from the very basics of OOP in the PHP scripting language such as the class syntax, what public methods are and how to set public properties using a class constructor to advanced concepts such as abstract classes, interfaces and the newest OO features in PHP not taught in Codecademy.  This Kata Series is sure to teach you all the knowledge and skills required to create clean, DRY PHP code by the time you have completed the entire Series.
